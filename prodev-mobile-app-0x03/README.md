## 📱 Overview
This is a sample React Native login screen built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/). The project demonstrates key React Native components such as `View`, `Text`, `TextInput`, `TouchableOpacity`, `Image`, and styling through `StyleSheet`. It also leverages `expo-router` for navigation and includes social authentication placeholders (Google, Facebook).

## 🎯 Objectives
- Reinforce familiarity with React Native syntax and layout
- Implement core components with custom styles
- Practice manual code writing for better retention
- Integrate local assets effectively
