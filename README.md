## 📱 Expo Go Setup

### Setup Instructions
1. Installed Expo Go on:
   - Android: via Google Play Store
2. Opened the Expo Go app and initiated account setup

### 🔧 Challenge Faced
During account creation, I encountered an error with the username. The system requires:
- Only alphanumeric characters, underscores (_), and single hyphens (-)
- Username must **not** begin or end with a hyphen
- No special characters or spaces allowed

### ✅ Resolution
Refactored my desired name to comply with the formatting rules:
- Original attempt: `Peter Adjao` ❌ (space and uppercase letters caused rejection)
- Final username: `peter_adjao` ✅ (lowercase, underscore used instead of space)

Successfully created the account and logged in via Expo Go.
